Consider a table, Quotes, with the following columns:
-dealer_name
-instrument
-price_quote
-quote_date

(a) Write a query that, for each instrument, returns the record with lowest quote received today.

SELECT MIN(price_quote) 
FROM Quotes WHERE DATE_FORMAT(price_quote, '%DD/%MM/%YYYY') is CURDATE()
GROUP BY instrument;


(b) Write a query that returns the 10 quotes with the 10 lowest prices recorded for today.
SELECT TOP 10 price_quote 
FROM Quotes 
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(price_quote, '%DD/%MM/%YYYY') == CURDATE()
ORDER BY price_quote DESC;
